### APIs Used
* REST Countries


## Approach Taken




### Brief
To design and build a MEAN stack app with our own design by partnering with other classmates.
The app must :

#### Server-side

* Use Mongo, Node & Express
* At least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
* Should include all RESTFUL actions for at least one of those models
* Include authentication to restrict access to appropriate users
* Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document
* Include automated tests


#### Client-side

* Use Angular to build a front-end that consumes your API
* Use SCSS instead of CSS
* Use Webpack & Yarn to manage dependencies and compile source code


### Featured Piece of Code

```

### Styling

We created our log using Tiffiny green similar colour ho

### Wins and Blockers


### Future Features

* Show the country and food that user has created on user profile page.
* Show the country and the food that user has voted on the user profile page.
* Apply external API (map) for the location of each country and the food.
* Create another route for user to manage their own profile.
* Improve responsive design.
